# nvidiaAIProject

Hello! My project uses imagetNet to process the test image to determine the item of clothing. The item of clothing runs through the classes to find out the approximate price of the clothing. The AI is trained to have a 90%+ confidence when finding out the item of clothing. The purpose is to use this for designers or anybody who is willing to sell or buy clothes.

## The Algorithm

The code depends on imageNet to find out the type of clothing it is. Then, with the given item in the dictionary, it gets a random value between the given price range to determine the average and approximate range of the clothing. Lastly, it prints out the item of clothing and the given price using a simple for loop.

## Running this project
